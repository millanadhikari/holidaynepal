            <div>
                <p>My heart is fluttering like silk in the wind
I cannot decide whether to fly or sit on the hilltop<br/>
To the dog-it’s puppy, puppy, to the cat-it’s meow meow
Our love is-waiting at the crossroads.<br/>
One-barrelled gun, two-barrelled gun, targeted at a deer.
It’s not the deer that I am aiming at,<br/> but at my beloved.
Aeroplane in the sky, motor on the roads, If not then bullock cart.<br/>
If your heart feels the same as mine then come..
The tiny baby calf is in danger at the precipice.<br/>
I couldn`t leave it there, let`s go together, my love. </p>
            </div>
            
        </div>
